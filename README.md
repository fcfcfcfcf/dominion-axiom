## User Guide

### Getting Started
This tool requires that the user have Python3 installed on thier machine.

In order to run your first analysis of Dominion games, clone this repo, then input the following command into your command line of choice (within the dominion-axiom directory):
```
python3 axiom <# of players> <player1 AI type> <player2 AI type> ... <playerN AI type> <# of games to play> <starting deck preset> <shop preset> 
```
For example, using the default deck and shop presets, simulating 10000 games with 4 players using the miser, common_sense, miser, and common_sense ai schemes, would look like this:
```
python3 axiom 4 miser common_sense miser common_sense 1000 default default
```
The output of the analysis will be printed to the console, and should look something like this:
```
......../dominion-axiom$ python3 axiom 4 miser common_sense miser common_sense 1000 default default
# of players: 4
simulating 1000 games
using deck preset: default

common_sense average score = 30.6695
miser average score = 29.073
```
Your exact average scores should of course be slightly different.
