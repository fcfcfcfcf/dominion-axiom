	<h1>What is this?</h1>
	<body>
		We all know the coolest card-turn based game is Dominion. This game has given us hours of fun, but have you ever wanted to always win? 
		Here we provide a test ground where people can upload python code that interacts with our implementation to make a dominion ai. 
		We have made some perliminary players for you, 
		<ul>
			<li><i>random</i>: is where the ai will just choose random choices for each stage of gameplay.</li>
			<li><i>The Miser</i>: is where the ai will ___</li>
			<li><i>Common Sense</i>: is where the ai will ___</li>
		</ul>

		At the moment, this is a pretty rudimentary implementation, so be nice to the website lmao. 
		<br>If you want to look at the code and make improvements yourself, click <a href="https://github.com/marshingjay/dominion-axiom">here</a> to look at our repo
